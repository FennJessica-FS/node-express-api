## NodeJS CRUD API

This project is a Node.js and Express API demonstrating full CRUD functionality using in-memory data storage. The API includes routes to create, retrieve, update, and delete user data, as well as a service check endpoint to confirm the server is running.

Postman was used to test all routes, including GET (all users and by ID), POST, PUT, and DELETE. Proper HTTP status codes and error handling are implemented throughout the application.
